# VITAforecast

![VITAforecast Banner](http://i.imgur.com/JX8pnKF.png)

A PS VITA application that grabs data from api.openweathermap.org, and parses the data to extract relevant details.

## Instructions:
1. Drag and drop the VPK into your vita's memory card.
2. Open Vitashell and install.
3. Make sure you have a working net connection and you're good to go.

## Note:
Please enter your zip code correctly. For example (Use without quotations):
Format: "ZIPCODE,ID"

- "Wv1,GB" = Wolverhampton, UK
- "07001,US" = Avenel, US
- "169-0072,JP" = Tōkyō-to, JP
- "75008,FR" = Palais-Royal, FR

## Controls:
- Square: Re-enter zip code and ID. 
- Start: Exit app.
- Triangle: Refresh data (although it already does this in the background).
